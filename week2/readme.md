Calculate the type/token ratio for the 2016 and 2017 state of the union speeches.
For tokenization, use Stanford's tokenizer, NLTK, or Spacy You must send the result along with a description of your processing (scripts, tools, ...)

For this assignment, we use one of the tokenizers to calculate the type/token ratio for the two
speeches given by Obama and Trump in the years 2016 and 2017. Type is a unique form
of a word and token is the graphic words. I used the spacy tokenizer and wrote a
Python function to capture the tokens and types to calculate the TTR ratio. With these results, we can
can tell which speech has the greatest variety of vocabulary, which is indicated by a
high number of TTRs.

The results show that the 2017 speech given by Trump has a greater variety
of vocabulary use compared to Obama's. Apparently, the two texts differ
from each other in terms of speech type if we look more closely at American politics.
In a State of the Union address, the president usually looks back on the past year and the
and the state of the nation, and also takes the opportunity to highlight the legislative agenda of his administration.
of his administration. Since this was Trump's first speech, it is said to be a
speech rather than a SOTU. Since their thinking is different, it is possible to see the
small difference in the ratio.
